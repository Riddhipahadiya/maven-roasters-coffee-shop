## Project Overview

The **Coffee Shop Power BI Dashboard** provides insights into sales, revenue, and customer behavior for a small coffee shop. This dashboard is designed to help business owners make data-driven decisions by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales by product category, revenue trends, and customer purchasing behavior.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains sales transaction records from a coffee shop. Key columns include:

- **Date:** The transaction date.
- **Product Category:** The type of product sold (e.g., coffee, bakery items, etc.).
- **Units Sold:** Number of units sold for each product.
- **Revenue:** Revenue generated from each sale.
- **Customer Type:** Regular or walk-in customers.

The raw data file (`coffee-shop2.csv`) has been used to develop a Power BI dashboard (`powerrbi.pbix`) to analyze the sales performance.

## Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard contains the following elements:

1. **Sales by Product Category** – Visualizes which categories are the top sellers.
2. **Revenue Trend** – Shows the revenue trend over time to help identify peak periods and slowdowns.
3. **Customer Purchase Analysis** – Displays customer segmentation (regular vs. walk-in customers) and their purchasing behavior.
4. **Top Selling Items** – Highlights the top-performing products to focus on best-sellers.
